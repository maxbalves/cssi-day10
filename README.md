# login-page-mini-project
For the week 2 mini-project, my group (Cody, Sana, Meghana, and me) attempted to do a working login/sign-up webpage that uses Firebase on the backend to read and write user credentials.<br/>
This was us using the Firebase RealTime Database and not Firebase Authentication.<br/>
We learned Firebase Auth the following week, but this was still a fun project.<br/>
Ignore the code for home.html/home.js...<br/>
We tried to implement the Spotify API as a bonus but didn't have enough time to figure out how to.<br/>
