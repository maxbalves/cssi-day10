# login-page-mini-project
For the week 2 mini-project, my group (Cody, Sana, Meghana, and me) attempted to do a working login/sign-up webpage that uses Firebase on the backend to read and write user credentials.
This was us using the Firebase RealTime Database and not Firebase Authentication.
We learned Firebase Auth the following week, but this was still a fun project.
Ignore the code for home.html/home.js...
We tried to implement the Spotify API as a bonus but didn't have enough time to figure out how to.
